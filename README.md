# GameProject
me testing out rendering and making a game

will be trying raylibc instead

# Compiling and running the game

I will be using cmake using the CMakeLists.txt file
to follow along and make the game
first cd into the gameproject folder
then 
'mkdir build && cd build'
'cmake ..'
'cmake --build .'
'game.exe'
this should make the build folder, use cmake to make the makefiles, then using the makefiles build and compile the game and then run it
