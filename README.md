# GameProject
me testing out rendering and making a game

will be trying raylibc instead

__________________________________________________________________

## Compiling and running the game

I will be using cmake using the [`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/ItsMoMoHippo/gameProject/blob/main/README.md) file
to follow along and make the game

> - first cd into the gameproject folder
> - `mkdir build && cd build`
> - `cmake ..`
> - `cmake --build .`
> - `game.exe`

this should make the build folder, use cmake to make the makefiles, then using the makefiles build and compile the game and then run it
